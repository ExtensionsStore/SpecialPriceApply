Special Price Apply
===================

Description

This module lets you activate/deactivate special prices to a grid of category products.


How to use
-------------------------
Upload the files to the root of your Magento install. Let the install script run. A
new attribute 'special_price_apply' and table 'aydus_specialpriceapply' will be 
installed. In the category admin, a new tab 'Category Special Prices' will show up

apply the special price to a product.
